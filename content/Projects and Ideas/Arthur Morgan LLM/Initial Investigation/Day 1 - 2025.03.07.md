Idea: I had the idea to understand how to create an LLM for personal development. I was also playing Red Dead Redemption 2 going for the platinum trophy playing as John Marston and I realised I missed Arthur but needed to carry on. The two idea merged in my head so I started researching...

I found the journal entries online https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption/comments/buxjuv/completed_arthurs_journal_pdf_and_zip/

Converted images to text using EasyOCR and python script /Users/t/repos/lloydh6/arthur_journal_converter/

I found https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption2/comments/pzynpj/red_dead_redemption_2_full_transcript_game_script/ which is the full game dialog

My plan is to use claude to help me generate the dataset that i will need in order to create an LLM that behaves like arthur from the afterlife.

Thought: It would be amazing if i could convert these responses to audio where its AM's voice

Problem: The context window is way too small for the whole story dialog, I need to split it, but this could cause problems, we shall see

I found https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/online/ocr-pdf.html which is a free OCR to text converter

I found https://unsloth.ai/ which lets you fine tune LLM's
